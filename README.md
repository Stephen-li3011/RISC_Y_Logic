## Summary

#### What

> This application is a calendar tool students can use to organize their schedule. It allowes students to upload preexisting schedules to the calendar, add events, and recommend events based on the student's interest and time availability. 

#### Why

> This application was made to help students, like ourselves, navigate their busy lives and live up to their academic potential. 

#### General

> This application is perfect for a student with an existing schedule. The student can input their course schedule into the calendar, which would display their schedule. Any additional events that come up can be manually added with the Add Event button. Using the event recommendation feature, the user can input their academic interests and the the application will output event searches based on the student's available time slots. The student can choose from the recommended events and add it to their calendar.
